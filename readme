Rirekisho is a resume-builder. It is not necessarily meant to be extremely
customizable, but rather a more procedurally-created resume tool.

The motivation behind this is mostly to be able to capture *all* the information
that a person wants in any number of resumes in a common manner and then be able
to easily create multiple tailored resumes without having to re-write a lot of
the same information or boilerplate.

(The name "rirekisho" comes from the Japanese word for resume: 履歴書. There is
no particular reason for choosing this name besides the fact that I wanted
something more interesting than "resume-something" as a package name and that
I'm currently learning Japanese.)
